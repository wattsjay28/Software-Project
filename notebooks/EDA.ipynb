Then, it utilizes a function to extract manufacturer names from the vehicle model strings, creating a new column named 'Manufacturer' to store these extracted names. The 'model' column is subsequently cleaned to remove manufacturer names, ensuring data consistency. Grouping the data by manufacturer and vehicle type, it counts the number of vehicles for each combination. Further refinement involves removing additional manufacturer names from the 'model' column and identifying unique manufacturers to update the manufacturer list. Finally, the data is grouped again by manufacturer and vehicle type to reflect the applied updates."
